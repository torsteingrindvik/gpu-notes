A paragraph in this article was interesting.

## Extinction

> The absortion of light due to scattering 

If a fog color setting, this term:

`col = scene * exp(-distance*b)`

So the color of our scene that gets extinguished over distance.

## Inscattering


If a fog color setting, this term:

`col = fog * (1.0 - exp(-distance*b))`

Which is a fog color that gets inscattered (collected?) over distance.
